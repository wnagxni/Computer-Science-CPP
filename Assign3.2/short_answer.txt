Backtracking Warmup
------
Q16. What is the value of totalMoves after stepping over the call to moveTower in hanoiAnimation?
A16. 15

Q17. What is the value of the totalMoves variable after stepping over the first recursive sub-call? (In other words, within moveTower just after stepping over the first recursive sub-call to moveTower inside the else statement.)
A17. 8

Q18. After breaking at the base case of moveTower and then choosing Step Out, where do you end up? (What function are you in, and at what line number?) What is the value of the totalMoves variable at this point?
A18. Line 67 in `moveTower` function; 1

Q19. What is the smallest possible input that you used to trigger the bug in the program?
A19. {1};


Q20. Identify the one-character error in the code and explain why that one-character bug causes the function to return the output you see when running on the minimal input you listed above. You should be able to specifically account for how the error causes the result to change from “completely correct” to “terribly wrong.”
A20. 子递归调用里`sumSoFar += v[index]` 中不仅将子递归函数中`sumSoFar`形参的值修改为了`sumSoFar+v[index]`
使用`+=`赋值的副作用是同时修改了父函数(本函数)中栈帧中sumSoFar的值,那么在第一个子递归返回时,
给第二个子递归传参时用到的`sumSoFar`变为了原来`sumSoFar+v[index]`,和原意不符


Voting (Please note that this part of A3 is completely optional and will only be considered for extra credit. If you did not submit code for this part of the assignment, Q19 and Q20 will not be considered.)
------
Q21. What is the Big O of computePowerIndex? Include your timing data and explain how it supports your reasoning.
Q19: O(2^n),随着size指数级上升

Q22. Use the Big O and timing data to estimate how long it would take to compute the power index for the 51 voting blocks in the U.S. Electoral College.
A22. use interploted function: y = a + 2^(kx), in which a = -1.9 and k = 21, we can predict the comsumed time will be about 12427.6 days (34 years).
